# Loan-Approval-Prediction-in-ML
 This project aims to automate the loan approval process for financial institutions using machine learning. By analyzing applicant attributes such as income, credit history, and loan amount, our model predicts loan approval outcomes. This approach helps streamline the approval process, saving time and resources while ensuring fairness and accuracy.
